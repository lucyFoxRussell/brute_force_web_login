    "# Simple Dictionary-based Login Attack\n",
    "\n",
    "In this project, I’ve created a Python script that demonstrates a basic dictionary-based login attack against a web application running on `http://127.0.0.1:5000`. The script tries to guess valid credentials by iterating through a set of usernames and testing them against a large password dictionary. The script looks for a success message in the server’s response to determine if the credentials are valid.\n",

    "How an attacker operates: This script demonstrates a basic dictionary attack where an attacker tries to guess credentials by cycling through common usernames and passwords.\n",

    "The importance of strong passwords: This exercise highlights why robust password policies, like requiring complex passwords, are critical for security.\n",

    "Rate-limiting and account lockouts: To defend against such attacks, rate-limiting and account lockouts are essential. They prevent brute-force attacks from being effective.\n",

    "Smoother progress feedback: Using sys.stdout.write and overwriting the line makes the progress smoother than standard print statements. It’s useful in scenarios like this when trying many combinations quickly."
